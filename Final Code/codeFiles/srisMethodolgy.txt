Methodology
-Talk about dataset.
-explain each attribute of an object.
-talk about using diifrent machine learning algos on dataset.
-explain working of each algo.
-say that results are depicted in evaluation section.

--> My approach
	-Phase 1
		-generating priority list.
		-using selection sort. Talk about selection sort.
		-talk about default priority list by comparing it with user defined priority list.
			--give an example of what will happen if user defined priority list is incomplete but the user still wants to drive autonomously.
	-Phase 2
		-Use c4.5 to classify detected objects.
		-check the priority of classifed objects in priority list(user defined priority list or default priority list which so ever is active.)
		-eliminate the object with least priority(i.e. car will hit that object)
